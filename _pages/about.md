I'm a robotics engineer and researcher. My main focus is robotic manipulation - the ability to control the environment through contact. My past reseach involves aerial manipulation and gripper design.

Currently, I conduct research in Prof. Jungwon Seo's group at HKUST Robotics Institute, as a research assistant (2021-2022) and MPhil student (2019-2021).
Prior to that, I was working on consumer drones and gimbals at DJI (2015-2018).
