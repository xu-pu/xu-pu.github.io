I am a robotics engineer and researcher, currently pursuing my PhD at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin, supervised by Prof. Oliver Brock. I am also affiliated with [Robotics and Biology (RBO) Laboratory](https://www.robotics.tu-berlin.de/) and [Science of Intelligence](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/).



Previously, I conducted research in Prof. Jungwon Seo's group at HKUST Robotics Institute, as a research assistant (2021-2022) and MPhil student (2019-2021). The projects involve aerial manipulation and gripper design. 



Prior to that, I also worked on consumer drones and gimbals at DJI (2015-2018).
